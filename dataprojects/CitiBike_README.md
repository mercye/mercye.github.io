#Will CitiBike be an alternative for L train commuters?

## about 
I used one month (June 2016) of citibike ridership data to find the most popular routes. I only used a 50000 member random sample from this data set to produce these results. Data manipulation happened in Python.

Using Cartodb, I mapped subway stations and overlaid the CitiBike routes so that I could see if CitiBike riders were beginning and ending trips near subway stations.
